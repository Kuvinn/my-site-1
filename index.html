        <h1>Info</h1>
        <br>
        This website was made with the intention of learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript via online sources and videoes. This project was started in August, 2023, and is still
        being updated throughout my last year of university. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Things may be rough around the edges, but I'm eager to learn and to optimize this website with what I learn in the future!

        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <p1> 
            Currently a third-year studying Computer Science (BS+MS) at the University of California, Riverside, Kevin is a learning coder and creator. 
            Hailing from his hometown of Anaheim, California, Kevin first was introduced to Javascript at Cypress High School, and went on to learn C++ and C# from his courses at UCR. 
            <br>
            <br>
            He has picked up his knowledge in HTML and CSS from YouTube tutorials, as well as a variety of online sources and references. 
            He is currently learning more about how to apply his HTML, CS, and JavaScript skills to create projects he is passionate about, and is also currently picking up Unity to learn game development.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In his spare time, Kevin likes to search for new music artists and work out. He is a Taekwondo black belt and aspires to learn more about the martial art. He loves the outdoors and heights, and spends much of his spare time practicing how to sketch.
